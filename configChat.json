It is often symbolized using phi, after the 21st letter of the Greek alphabet.Historically, the number can be seen in the architecture of many ancient creations, like the Great Pyramids and the Parthenon. In the Great Pyramid of Giza, the length of each side of the base is 756 feet with a height of 481 feet. The ratio of the base to the height is roughly 1.5717, which is close to the Golden ratio. \nIn an equation form, it looks like this:\n\na/b = (a+b)/a = 1.6180339887498948420 …",
